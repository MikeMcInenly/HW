        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <h3>H1: Wind speeds at Salar de Pajonales do not change seasonally.<p></p>
        H2: Wind speed and direction at Salar de Pajonales have an approximately normal distribution.</h3>

        <h2>Wind speeds (m/s) from October 2018 to November 2019, Salar de Pajonales, Chile.</h2>
        <h3>These are the raw data.  Click and drag a box on the lower graph to zoom in on the selected time period.
        We can see that wind speeds not only change seasonally but also experience diurnal changes.</h3>

        <h3>
            Wind speed histogram.<p></p>
            Geologists typically work with right skewed data.  The histogram is a good way to see
            if the data can benefit from a transformation.  We can see the wind speeds are right skewed and a log
            transformation of the y-axis should smooth out the distribution.
        </h3>
        <div id="vis_histo_speed"></div>
        <div id="vis_histo_logspeed"></div>
        <div id="vis_histo_relfreqspeed"></div>
<p>
</p>
        <h3>Looks like a log transform did not help because of the large number of zero and negative values.  These might
            be sensor errors or something else because log speed should not return a negative value.  I want to remove
        them from the dataset, but I should look at the relative frequency of all wind speeds to get a better idea of how
        they are distributed.
            <p></p>
            We can see in the red histogram 60% of wind speeds are 2 m/s (~4.5 mph) or less.  These speeds are not
            high enough to include in my multiple regression model and can be removed.

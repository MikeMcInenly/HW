    The chord diagram below uses counts to show how wind directions change from November 2018 to November 2019, and it shows the relationship
    between changes in wind directions with respect to seasonal change. A matrix of counts representing the number of times wind blew from the north, south, east, and west for months that represent the beginning
    of a new season.  Data were collected in the southern hemisphere, therefore, the progression from fall, winter, spring, to summer is represented
    by march, june, september, and december.

    I choose the chord diagram because each chord represents a bidirectional flow between cardinal direction for a given month that represents a change in season.
    In other words, the diagram visualizes changes in wind directions at Salar de Pajonales, Chile for select months over the course of one year.  The circle is split up into four cardinal directions with
    the length of each group scaled to the number of times wind blew from that direction.  We can see the majority of direction observations original from the south, as is expected
    for the area.  Having spent a week at the field site, I observed major winds that originated from the north during the month of october.  From these observations, I hypothesize that
    wind directions as Salar de Pajonales behave atypically with respect to the prevailing winds in South America.  I've called upon the chord diagram to address this question.

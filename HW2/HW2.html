<h1>Homework #2</h1>
<h3>Yellowstone National Park is home to one of 12 super volcanoes on this planet.  Below the surface of the Park exists
a multi-chamber magmatic body that ranges in composition from granite to basalt.  The upper granitic chamber is the source
rock for most of the rock formations found in the Park today.  Silica rich, extrusive igneous rocks, known as rhyolite,
create different formation types such as lava flows and resurgent domes.  Resurgent domes form by uplift due to
increasing temperatures and pressures as the magma chambers evolve.  Eventually these domes fracture along the base and create weak zones where
fluids are able to circulate.  Major volcanic eruptions happen when these fracture zones are deep enough to release the
pressure caused by the magma chamber.  Lava flows occur when underground fractures are present and pressures high but not prime for eruption.
The last major eruption in the Park was roughly 640,000 years ago, however, the last laval flow was only 70,000 years ago,
and today there are two active resurgent domes.<p></p>
Silica rich lava is very viscous and flows across a surface much like toothpaste flowing downhill.  Once cooled, these flows
have a cliff like appearance with large changes in elevation over short distances.  A resurgent dome, similar to a
skin blister, is an uplifted piece of ground and characterized by a more gradual change in elevation over distance.<p></p>
Centered in a 10-meter resolution digital elevation model from the USGS is the Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, WY.
This dataset is used to evaluate the following hypotheses.</h3><p></p>
<h2>Hypotheses:</h2>
<h3>H1: Geyser basins tend to favor areas where fractures promote hydrothermal water circulation in the shallow subsurface.
These factures zones are commonly associated with the edges of lava flows.  Is the Upper Geyser Basin (home to Old Faithful
Geyser) located near the edge of a lava flow?<p></p>

    H2: Lava flows and resurgent domes are characterized by different rates of change in elevation over distance.  Can
 we accurately identify the difference between these rocks formations solely on changes in elevation?</h3>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Visualization color is an important, yet often misused component in science communication. A recent article by
Crameri, F., et. al., (2020) in Nature Communications produced this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19160-7/figures/6">flow chart</a>
in an effort to simplify color choices.  I used the flowchart to guide my choice of color ramps, but for the sake of science
I did not follow the recommendation for one of the visualizations.  If you haven't clicked the flowchart link yet, good!
Please grade the visualizations before looking at the color selection criteria outlined by the flow chart.  I am curious
about the differences in opinion!  For the sake of ditching widely used elevation color ramps, I assumed my data were not
associated with an intuitive color scheme.<p></p>
